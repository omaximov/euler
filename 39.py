If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

'''
Intuition for solution: integers a,b,c such that a^2+b^2=c^2. Moreover, we need a+b+c=P, for fixed P (which we iterate).
substituting for c, see that we need only iterate over a, and find b such that 

b=p(p-2a)/(2(p-a)).

If this expression is an integer, then it must be that c is an integer. 
Moreover, we can reduce the range for which we iterate over a by observing that a+b>c, a+c>b, and b+c>a. Therefore, a is bounded by p/(2+sqrt(2)).
